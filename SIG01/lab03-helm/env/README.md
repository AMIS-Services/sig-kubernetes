Can be used with Vagrant to quickly get an environment up and running. Requires the installation of two plugins:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize

vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Put both the files in this directory in a folder and do vagrant up. Do check if your machine has the requirements to run the VM which is defined in the Vagrantfile
